# μDetector

μDetector is an Intrusion Detection Tool for Microservices written in Python. 

## What is it?
μDetector is a tool that relies on proof-of-concept techniques of Intrusion Detection and automates their functioning for Kubernetes and KubeEdge deployments. In practice, after the user has provided a configuration, the tool uses monitoring agents to automatically collect system calls from the desired containers and transfers them over to the Intrusion Detection module of the tool. This module covers all the stages of anomaly-based intrusion detection and all activity classified as anomalous will trigger alarms in real-time indicating a possible intrusion in the microservices’ application. The user can interact with the tool and its monitoring capabilities through a command-line interface or a web dashboard.

## Installation
Pre-requisites include a kubernetes cluster setup (for example [TeaStore](https://github.com/DescartesResearch/TeaStore) or [Sockshop](https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo)), sysdig (v0.28.0) and a redis server installed and configured

```bash
git clone [REPOSITORY]
cd detector
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```python
# On the master node of the cluster
kubeproxy
python3.8 daemon/main.py

# On the worker nodes of the cluster
python3.8 agent/main.py

# On the local machine that runs the tool
python3.8 detector/main.py
```
Use the CLI or access the Web Dashboard at http://localhost:5001/

Tip: Consider using tmux sessions
